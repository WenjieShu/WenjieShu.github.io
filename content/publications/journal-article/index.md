abstract: We propose a Cross Modulation Transformer (CMT) for pansharpening that integrates modulation techniques from signal processing into attention to effectively fuse panchromatic and multispectral images. A hybrid loss combining wavelet and Fourier transforms further improves fusion quality.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
